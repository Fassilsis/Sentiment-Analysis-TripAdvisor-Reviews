Many agree that online customer feedback mechanisms are a great way to get an unfiltered view of how customers are rating services. However, research has shown that most online reviews can mislead consumers as consumers' ratings do not significantly correlate with actual quality. In this project, I summarized the overall sentiments and predict ratings using different machine learning techniques on the basis of a TripAdvisor dataset from Kaggle. After the data filtering process, I implemented the rule-based sentiment analysis approach. For prediction, I make use of the Random Forest algorithm, owing to its ability to act upon non-normalized data. Finally, in line with other researches, I found out that ratings and sentiments are not highly related. That is, ratings do not reflect customersâ€™ sentiment.
